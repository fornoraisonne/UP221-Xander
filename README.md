# UP221-Xander
## Profile
I'm Xander, I use they/he pronouns and i'm a second year MPH student studying environmental health sciences. Wish I had had the forethought to apply to the MPH/MURP combined program on my way in, oops. 

This is my repository for UP221, a UCLA Urban Planning graduate course on geographic information systems and spatial data science. 

I'm interested in pesticide exposures, food security & agroforestry, housing & environmental justice, heat/shade equity and cobenefit analysis of climate action policy.
